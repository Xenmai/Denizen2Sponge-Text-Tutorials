Changes to this Guide
=====================

As the scripting engine continues to be developed, this guide will be updated 
as well. Keep in mind though that the updating process is a delicate task and 
relevant changes on the plugin might require some time before being properly 
reflected here. Nevertheless, these tutorials won't become obsolete as useful 
learning tools, specially for people starting out in the scripting world.

If you want to keep track of actual changes applied to this documentation, you 
can check the full history in the **GitHub repository**. That's also the place to 
go if you have any suggestions or improvements, as you can simply post an issue 
there.

You can also contact us if you are really interested on this project, be it the 
guides or the actual scripting engine. Best way to do so is by joining our 
**Discord server**, where we'll happily discuss relevant information.

Additional Help
===============

Although this set of tutorials might be a good starting point for learning how 
customize your Sponge Minecraft server, there's times where you might need more 
help. A important tool you'll soon start using is the **Denizen2Sponge Meta 
Documentation**, as it'll let you learn about anything used in your scripts.

We'll also be glad to provide custom support in the **#denizen2sponge** channel of 
our **Discord server**. In this channel there's even a handy bot that lets you 
quickly search through documentation. Or you could just drop by and have a chat 
with us!
