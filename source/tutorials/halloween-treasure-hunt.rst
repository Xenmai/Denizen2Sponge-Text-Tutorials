Introduction
============

Welcome again to the **Denizen2Sponge Scripting Engine**. This is our first 
tutorial, so we'll start with the basics. After downloading the plugin and 
running the server once to create the needed files, the first thing we need to 
do is locate the Denizen *scripts folder* inside ``config/denizen/``. This is where 
we'll create our script files, which have the ``.dsc`` extension. Now we have to 
get a bit more familiar with Denizen's syntax, and there's no better place for 
that than the documentation. We'll focus on some of the most common ingredients 
we'll be using in our scripts:

*Script Containers:*
  As their name suggests, they're meant to store scripts. There are different 
  types, depending on the nature of the script we want to make. They consist of 
  a *name* key, a ``type:`` subkey and value and some other subkeys that belong to 
  each type. You can also specify the level of debugging of a script container 
  through the ``debug:`` subkey.

*Commands:*
  These are placed after a ``-`` in executable parts of our scripts and are in 
  charge of *making something happen* in the Minecraft server. From giving items 
  to players to creating artificial explosions, commands will be a key 
  component of any script.

*Tags:*
  These are text placeholders that Denizen replaces with objects at runtime. 
  They are always wrapped in ``< >`` and consits of a *tag base*, which retrieves or 
  creates an object; and *modifiers*, which transform the original base into 
  other types of objects. As many modifiers as you want can be concatenated 
  inside a tag, as long as they are always separated by a ``.`` and their input 
  object type matches the previous output type.

*Events:*
  These are placed inside world script containers and their job is to *listen to 
  actions* happening within our Minecraft server. When triggered, they'll 
  execute their script section, filled with commands and tags. Events have 
  special tags that are stored within the ``<context`` base. These unique tags offer 
  information directly attached to the action that took place, such as the 
  location when an explosion occurs.

First Steps
===========

Now let's jump (or slowly crawl) into our first script. In our case, we want to 
make a **Halloween Treasure Hunt** event in our *Hub world*. We plan on manually 
placing some hidden pumpkins ourselves, and reward players for finding (and 
left clicking) them.

.. note::
   This tutorial assumes our *Hub world* is in fact called ``Hub``.

First of all, we'll need to create a *new script file* (for example 
``Halloween_Treasure_Hunt.dsc``) and build a world script container, which listens 
to events happening within our server. We just have to give it a name, like 
``Halloween_Treasure_Hunt``, and set the ``type:`` key as ``world``. In addition to this, 
we'll also set the ``debug:`` key to ``full``. This will make our script print in the 
console everything it does and help us solve errors. It is not needed, so we 
can just remove it later on. We'll now add an ``events:`` subkey, which will hold 
the executable code we're going to write.

Our file with the script container looks like this:

.. code-block:: dscript
   :name: figure_1_1
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 1-4

   Halloween_Treasure_Hunt:
   type: world
   debug: full
   events:

.. rst-class:: figurecaption

**Figure 1.1** Our first world script container

It's worth noting that Denizen scripts follow **YAML**'s indentation rules, with 
either *2 or 4-space tabs*. We'll be using **D2IDE** ourselves, so this tutorial's 
code will be formatting according to this text editor. You can also just use 
**Notepad++** until the specialized *IDE* is officially released, but you'll have to 
make sure the tabs are replaced with actual spaces. There's a settings option 
in that automatically does that for us, so no problem.

Now we need to find an event that fits our case. Looking through the *event 
documentation* list, ``on player left clicks block`` looks like our best bet. We'll 
just test it for now, so we add it under the events key and end the line with a 
``:``. Inside this event we can place our first command. A good option for testing 
purposes is just to show a word in console. The command for this is ``echo``. As 
the documentation explains, its syntax is very simple. We feel the hype, so 
we'll go with an ``- echo "yay"``.

Our script should be the following at this point:

.. code-block:: dscript
   :name: figure_1_2
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 5,6

   Halloween_Treasure_Hunt:
   type: world
   debug: full
   events:
     on player left clicks block:
     - echo "yay"

.. rst-class:: figurecaption

**Figure 1.2** Our first working world script

It's time to *save* the script file, *reload* scripts ingame with ``/ex reload`` and 
*trigger the event* by left clicking a block. We should now be able to see a cute 
little ``yay`` (along with some debug information) in the console, just as we 
expected. That's great, but the event is being triggered no matter what block 
type we click on, and that's not ideal.

Core Functionality
==================

Our next step should be to limit this so it works with *pumpkins* only. The best 
way to achieve that is with *event switches*. Switches are internal checks that 
decide whether or not an event should fire. Each event has different available 
switches, so make sure to read the *documentation*. We can see there's a ``type`` 
switch that checks the broken block type, so we'll use that. Adding 
``type:pumpkin`` right after the original event (and before the ending colon) 
should work for us.

We should not forget that we don't want players to get rewards from pumpkins in 
other worlds, so why not use another switch? According to the same 
documentation, our event has a ``world`` switch, so it's as easy as adding 
``world:Hub`` to the event line as well.

The updated event line is now:

.. code-block:: dscript
   :name: figure_1_3
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 5

   Halloween_Treasure_Hunt:
   type: world
   debug: full
   events:
     on player left clicks block type:pumpkin world:Hub:
     - echo "yay"

.. rst-class:: figurecaption

**Figure 1.3** Our first contact with event switches

We should *save*, *reload* and *test* again now. After a bit of trying, we've noticed 
that clicking *any block* in *any world* no longer echoes ``yay`` to the console, 
except for *pumpkin* ones in the *Hub world*. Perfect!

We're ready to move further ahead and actually give a *reward* to the player 
clicking the block. Since we're nice server owners, the prize will be a free 
*diamond*. This is when the ``give`` command comes in handy. Its *syntax* requires 
two arguments: a *player* and an *item*.

When reading command documentation, It's important to keep in mind that 
arguments inside ``< >`` are *not literal* and need to be replaced, while ``[ ]`` means 
an argument is *optional*.

As we explained earlier, events have specific information that can be accessed 
through the ``<context`` tag. For example, player events are always linked to the 
*player* that triggered them. This player object can be easily retrieved with 
the ``<context.player>`` tag, although this is a special case and we can just use 
``<player>`` as a shortcut. This player object will be the *target* of the ``give`` 
command. For the second argument, just specifying ``diamond`` will be enough.

The full command line will then be ``- give <player> diamond``.

Now it's time to make sure it works. After *saving* and *reloading* scripts again, 
it should be giving us a *diamond* every time we click the *pumpkin*. While players 
will totally love this, we should probably avoid giving out unlimited diamonds.

That's easy to fix though, we just have to remove the pumpkin once it's 
clicked. If we do it before even giving out the reward, we make sure it won't 
be clicked twice. We'll use the ``setblock`` command (syntax here), which requires 
a *location* and a *block type*. Yet again, we'll use a *context* tag to retrieve the 
location, in this case ``<context.location>``. The block type, on the other hand, 
will be just ``air`` as we want to remove the original pumpkin.

Our script with these new commands should look like this:

.. code-block:: dscript
   :name: figure_1_4
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 7,8

   Halloween_Treasure_Hunt:
   type: world
   debug: full
   events:
     on player left clicks block type:pumpkin world:Hub:
     - echo "yay"
     - setblock <context.location> air
     - give <player> diamond

.. rst-class:: figurecaption

**Figure 1.4** Our first script with more functionality

Rinse and repeat: save, reload scripts and do a quick test. Amazing! This 
deserves a "yay". Speaking of yaysâ€¦ we don't need to echo ``yay`` anymore, so 
we better remove that.

Topping It Off
==============

Let's make it even more fun. What if *jack o' lanterns* gave a diamond to *every 
online player*? Yeah, we can make that happen too! Let's start by making a copy 
of the event we already have and its contents. We now want to change the ``type:`` 
switch from ``pumpkin`` to ``lit_pumpkin``.

Inside the event, we need to *wrap* the give command with a ``foreach`` loop block 
(with syntax). This loop takes a *list* when it starts and executes some commands 
for *every object* on the list. In our case, the list of *online players* can be 
accessed through ``<server.online_players>``.

Then inside the ``foreach``, we can retrieve the currently *looped object* with 
``<def[foreach_value]>``. Replace ``<player>`` in the give command with this 
new object tag and we're ready to go.

Here's the complete second event:

.. code-block:: dscript
   :name: figure_1_5
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 9-12

   Halloween_Treasure_Hunt:
   type: world
   debug: full
   events:
     on player left clicks block type:pumpkin world:Hub:
     - setblock <context.location> air
     - give <player> diamond
     
     on player left clicks block type:lit_pumpkin world:Hub:
     - setblock <context.location> air
     - foreach start <server.online_players>:
       - give <def[foreach_value]> diamond

.. rst-class:: figurecaption

**Figure 1.5** Our first script with a second event

Other nice addition would be letting the players know they have received a 
reward. For the first event we can use the ``tell`` command. Its syntax is familiar 
by now, so we'll go ahead and write 
``- tell <player> "You've found a pumpkin! Here's your reward!"``.

.. note::
   Double quotes (``" "``) are used to group text so it's treated as a single argument.

But we can make it even fancier. In the second event we'll be using ``announce`` 
instead so everybody knows who their new hero is. According to its syntax, this 
command only needs a message argument, but we'd like to know the *name* of the 
player who found the hidden block. Well, that's not a problem. We already know 
that the player who clicked the block can be retrieved with ``<player>``, so why 
not use a tag modifier to know this information?

Our command would be as easy 
``- announce "<player.name> has found a jack o' lantern. Everybody gets a reward!"``

We just have to make sure it *works as intended*, and finally set the ``debug:`` key 
to ``minimal`` so only error messages are shown. No more console *spam*!

Finally, this is the full script that we've created:

.. code-block:: dscript
   :name: figure_1_6
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 3,8,14

   Halloween_Treasure_Hunt:
   type: world
   debug: minimal
   events:
     on player left clicks block type:pumpkin world:Hub:
     - setblock <context.location> air
     - give <player> diamond
     - tell <player> "You've found a pumpkin! Here's your reward!"
     
     on player left clicks block type:lit_pumpkin world:Hub:
     - setblock <context.location> air
     - foreach start <server.online_players>:
       - give <def[foreach_value]> diamond
     - announce "<player.name> has found a jack o' lantern. Everybody gets a reward!"

This should be it for now. Enjoy your brand new **Halloween Treasure Hunt** event 
and *happy scripting*!
