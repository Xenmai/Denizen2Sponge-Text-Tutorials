## Building

### Installation

Requires Python 3.5+ and Sphinx to build.

Instructions on how to install Sphinx can be found at: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html

### Rebuilding

After Sphinx is installed, you can build by running `sphinx-build -ab html source/ build/`

This will create a fully built static web pages folder in `build/`.

## Other Tools

You may additionally choose to install "doc8" (a simple rST style checker) for Python.
This can be achieved by running `pip install doc8`.

## License
